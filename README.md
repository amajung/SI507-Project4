SI 507 Project 4 by Amanda Jung

In this project, the goal was to write code to scrape/cache/extract specific data from the National Park Service site. It consist of the files SI507_project4.py, advanced_expiry_caching.py, and requirements.txt to run it and produces the files sample_secondprog_cache.json and parks_data.csv as a product.

The file SI507_project4.py contains code that uses the Caching tool from advanced_expiry_caching.py to CACHE the data and code that scrapes and extracts data from the National Park Service site to get the park information from each state such as each park's site name, type, description, location, and state.

The file requirements.txt contains the packages that are necessary to run the files of code listed above.
